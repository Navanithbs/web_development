            <h1>This is article 35A</h1>
            <p class="fp">Article 35A of the Indian Constitution was an article empowered the Jammu and Kashmir state's legislature to define "permanent residents" of the state and provide special rights and privileges to those permanent residents.[1] It was added to the Constitution through a Presidential Order, i.e., The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 – issued by the President of India on 14 May 1954, under Article 370.[2] The state of Jammu and Kashmir defined these privileges to include the ability to purchase land and unmovable property, ability to vote and contest elections, seeking government employment and availing other state benefits such as higher education and health care. Non-permanent residents of the state, even if Indian citizens, were not entitled to these 'privileges'.</p>
            <p>No person who is not a Permanent Resident of Jammu and Kashmir can own property in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

            <h1>This is article 370</h1>
            <p class="fp">Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947[1][2]—allowing it to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[3][4] The government of India revoked this special status in August 2019 through a Presidential Order and the passage of a resolution in Parliament.</p>
            <p>On 5 August 2019, President Ram Nath Kovind issued a constitutional order superseding the 1954 order, and making all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[10][11][12] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, he issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[13]</p>
